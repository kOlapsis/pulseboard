# Kubernetes Guide

PulseBoard runs natively on Kubernetes with read-only RBAC, namespace filtering, and workload-level monitoring out of the box.

---

## Deployment

Apply the provided manifests:

```bash
kubectl create namespace pulseboard
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/
```

This creates:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ServiceAccount** | `pulseboard` — identity for API access |
| **ClusterRole** | Read-only access to pods, logs, services, events, workloads, and metrics |
| **ClusterRoleBinding** | Binds the role to the service account |
| **Deployment** | Single replica with security hardening |
| **PersistentVolumeClaim** | 1 Gi for SQLite storage |
| **Service** | ClusterIP on port 80 |

---

## RBAC Permissions

PulseBoard requests the minimum permissions needed for monitoring:

```yaml
rules:
  # Core resources — read-only
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "pods/log", "services", "namespaces", "events"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  # Workloads — read-only
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments", "statefulsets", "daemonsets", "replicasets"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  # Metrics — read-only
  - apiGroups: ["metrics.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

PulseBoard never creates, modifies, or deletes any resource in your cluster.

!!! info "Metrics Server required"
    Resource metrics (CPU/memory) require [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
    to be installed in the cluster. Container monitoring works without it.

---

## Security Hardening

The default deployment includes:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  fsGroup: 65534
containers:
  - securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop: ["ALL"]
```

A `/tmp` emptyDir is mounted for SQLite WAL temporary files since the root filesystem is read-only.

---

## Namespace Filtering

By default, PulseBoard monitors all namespaces. Use environment variables to restrict scope:

### Allowlist

Only monitor specific namespaces:

```yaml
env:
  - name: PULSEBOARD_K8S_NAMESPACES
    value: "default,production,staging"
```

### Blocklist

Monitor all namespaces except specific ones:

```yaml
env:
  - name: PULSEBOARD_K8S_EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES
    value: "kube-system,kube-public,cert-manager"
```

!!! tip "System namespaces"
    `kube-system` and `kube-public` are excluded by default when using the blocklist.
    You do not need to add them explicitly.

If both `PULSEBOARD_K8S_NAMESPACES` and `PULSEBOARD_K8S_EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES` are set, the allowlist takes precedence.

---

## Workload Monitoring

PulseBoard groups pods by their owning workload:

| Workload | What PulseBoard tracks |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Deployment** | Replica count, ready pods, rollout status |
| **StatefulSet** | Ordered pod states, persistent volume claims |
| **DaemonSet** | Node coverage, desired vs ready counts |

Each workload appears as a single entry in the dashboard with aggregated health status. Individual pods are accessible in the detail view.

---

## Runtime Detection

PulseBoard auto-detects Kubernetes in this order:

1. `PULSEBOARD_RUNTIME=kubernetes` environment variable (explicit override)
2. `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` environment variable (set automatically by Kubernetes for in-cluster pods)
3. `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or `~/.kube/config` file (for out-of-cluster development)

To force Kubernetes mode:

```yaml
env:
  - name: PULSEBOARD_RUNTIME
    value: "kubernetes"
```

---

## Health Probes

The deployment includes liveness and readiness probes:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/v1/health
    port: http
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 30
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/v1/health
    port: http
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## Resource Limits

Default resource requests and limits:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 50m
    memory: 64Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 256Mi
```

Adjust based on the number of monitored workloads. PulseBoard is lightweight — 50-100 workloads run comfortably within these limits.

---

## Scaling Considerations

!!! warning "Single replica only"
    PulseBoard uses SQLite with a single-writer pattern. The deployment strategy is set to
    `Recreate` — do not scale beyond 1 replica.

For high availability, ensure your PersistentVolumeClaim uses a storage class with adequate durability.

---

## Exposing the Dashboard

### Ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: pulseboard
  namespace: pulseboard
spec:
  rules:
    - host: pulse.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: pulseboard
                port:
                  name: http
```

### Port Forward (Development)

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n pulseboard svc/pulseboard 8080:80
```

Open **http://localhost:8080**.
