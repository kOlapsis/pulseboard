# PulseBoard

**The all-in-one monitoring dashboard your self-hosted stack deserves.**

Drop a single container. Watch everything. Sleep at night.

## What is PulseBoard?

Most self-hosters juggle 3-5 tools to monitor their stack: one for containers, one for uptime, one for certs, one for metrics, and yet another for a status page. PulseBoard replaces all of them with a single binary, zero external dependencies, and zero configuration to get started.

Deploy one container, and PulseBoard auto-discovers your entire stack. Docker or Kubernetes — it does not matter.

## Key Features

- **[Container Monitoring](features/containers.md)** — Zero-config auto-discovery for Docker and Kubernetes. State tracking, health checks, restart loop detection, log streaming.
- **[Endpoint Monitoring](features/endpoints.md)** — HTTP and TCP checks defined as Docker labels. Response times, uptime history, sparklines.
- **[Heartbeat & Cron Monitoring](features/heartbeats.md)** — Create a monitor, get a URL, curl from your cron job. Tracks durations, exit codes, missed deadlines.
- **[TLS Certificate Monitoring](features/certificates.md)** — Auto-detection from HTTPS endpoints. Alerts at 30, 14, 7, 3, and 1 day before expiry. Full chain validation.
- **[Resource Metrics](features/resources.md)** — CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O per container. Historical charts, alert thresholds, top consumers view.
- **[Update Intelligence](features/updates.md)** — OCI registry scanning, digest comparison. Know when your images have updates available.
- **[Alert Engine](features/alerts.md)** — Unified alerts across all sources. Webhook and Discord channels. Silence rules, exponential backoff.
- **[Public Status Page](features/status-page.md)** — Component groups, incident management, scheduled maintenance.
- **[MCP Server](features/mcp.md)** — Expose monitoring data to AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor) via the Model Context Protocol. 18 tools, stdio and HTTP transports.

## Quick Start

Get PulseBoard running in 30 seconds:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  pulseboard:
    image: ghcr.io/kolapsis/pulseboard:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - pulseboard-data:/data
    environment:
      PULSEBOARD_DB: "/data/pulseboard.db"
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  pulseboard-data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** — your containers are already there. No configuration needed.
