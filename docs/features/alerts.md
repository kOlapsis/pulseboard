# Alert Engine

Unified alerts across all monitoring sources. Route by severity, source, or entity to specific webhook channels. Silence rules for planned maintenance. Exponential backoff retry on delivery failures.

---

## Alert Sources

PulseBoard generates alerts from every monitoring subsystem:

| Source | Events | Default Severity |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Container** | `restart_loop`, `health_unhealthy` | Warning |
| **Endpoint** | `consecutive_failure` | Critical |
| **Heartbeat** | `deadline_missed` | Critical |
| **Certificate** | `expiring`, `expired`, `chain_invalid` | Critical |
| **Resource** | `cpu_threshold`, `memory_threshold` | Warning |
| **Update** | `available` | Info |

---

## Notification Channels

PulseBoard delivers alerts to webhook channels. Supported formats:

### Slack

```bash
POST /api/v1/channels
{
  "name": "ops-slack",
  "type": "slack",
  "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../xxx"
}
```

### Discord

```bash
POST /api/v1/channels
{
  "name": "ops-discord",
  "type": "discord",
  "url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
}
```

### Microsoft Teams

```bash
POST /api/v1/channels
{
  "name": "ops-teams",
  "type": "teams",
  "url": "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/..."
}
```

### Generic HTTP Webhook

For any other service, use a generic webhook:

```bash
POST /api/v1/channels
{
  "name": "custom-webhook",
  "type": "webhook",
  "url": "https://your-service.example.com/alert"
}
```

PulseBoard sends a JSON payload with alert details to the configured URL.

---

## Routing Rules

Route specific alerts to specific channels. Routing rules filter by source, severity, or entity.

```bash
POST /api/v1/channels/{id}/rules
{
  "source": "endpoint",
  "severity": "critical"
}
```

You can also route alerts per container using Docker labels:

```yaml
labels:
  pulseboard.alert.channels: "slack,email"
  pulseboard.alert.severity: "critical"
```

---

## Testing Channels

Send a test alert to verify your channel configuration:

```bash
POST /api/v1/channels/{id}/test
```

---

## Silence Rules

Suppress alerts during planned maintenance windows. Silence rules prevent alert delivery without discarding the events.

```bash
# Create a silence rule
POST /api/v1/silence
{
  "reason": "Scheduled database maintenance",
  "starts_at": "2026-03-01T02:00:00Z",
  "ends_at": "2026-03-01T04:00:00Z",
  "matchers": {
    "source": "endpoint",
    "entity_id": "postgres-health"
  }
}

# List active silence rules
GET /api/v1/silence

# Cancel a silence rule
DELETE /api/v1/silence/{id}
```

!!! tip "Use silence rules for deployments"
    Create a silence rule before deploying to avoid alerting on expected
    container restarts and brief endpoint downtime.

---

## Retry and Backoff

When a webhook delivery fails, PulseBoard retries with exponential backoff:

- Attempt 1: immediate
- Attempt 2: 30 seconds
- Attempt 3: 1 minute
- Attempt 4: 2 minutes
- Attempt 5: 4 minutes

This ensures alerts are delivered even when the receiving service is temporarily unavailable.

---

## Viewing Alerts

### Active Alerts

```
GET /api/v1/alerts/active
```

Returns only currently active (unresolved) alerts.

### Alert History

```
GET /api/v1/alerts

### Single Alert

```
GET /api/v1/alerts/{id}
```
